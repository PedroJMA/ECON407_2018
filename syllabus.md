## Topics in Macroeconomics (Computational Macro)
This is a course in the computational tools used in modern macroeconomic.  The class will be a mixture of theory and programming.

- **Instructor:** jesse.perla@ubc.ca
- **Office Hours:** Thursday 10am-12pm in Iona 206
- **Prerequisites:** One of ECON 301, ECON 304 and one of ECON 302, ECON 305 and one of ECON 303, ECON 306.
  - A little programming experience is very valuable, but you will be able to fill in the blanks with some hard work.
- **Textbook:** We will follow a subset of https://lectures.quantecon.org/jl/
- **Learning Environment:** Come to class on time.   No cellphones.

## Course Materials and Communications
All materials will be provided online:
- Class Materials: https://github.com/jlperla/ECON407_2018
- Communications, Announcements, and Grades: canvas.ubc.ca

## Grading
This will be project and homework based, with no exams.

- 5-6 Problem sets (mostly computational): 75%
- Final Computational Project 25%
  - You will have a great deal of freedom to implement a small final project using what we learn in the class

A word of warning: if you have never taken a class with a lot of programming assignments, it is a great deal of work, but ultimately very rewarding.

## Programming Language Choice

The lectures notes are available in both [Python](https://lectures.quantecon.org/py/) and [Julia](https://lectures.quantecon.org/jl/), and you will have the choice of which language to use.  However, I will use Julia myself and cannot promise to help you with python programming.

When you are deciding on the language (which you can switch at will, or submit assignments in both!) consider that Julia is both less mature, but much more promising.  If you were just planning on using these skills in the next 6 months then Python is the best choice, but over the next 2-5 years it is worth the pain to learn Julia earlier.  See [Python vs. Julia](https://lectures.quantecon.org/about_lectures.html#python-or-julia) for more details.

To get started, go to https://github.com/econtoolkit/julia for more instructions.  You should be able to do your coursework on python or julia hosted webservices (i.e. http://next.juliabox.com and https://pims.syzygy.ca) rather than installing any software.
